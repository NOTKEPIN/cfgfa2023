                    Alham B. stated:</p>
                <p><em>“This is such a blessing. We were forced to leave our home in Eastern Europe 
                    and settle here in Antioch with very few belongings. I came to the event hoping 
                    to get some help for my children and my family is leaving with new shoes and clothes. 
                    Thank you, we are truly grateful.”</em></p>

                <p><em>“We came here to see what this event was about, and I was shocked to see what 
                    was offered and to see that you have items for everyone in my family. It was amazing. 
                    Buying shoes and clothes for my older kids is expensive and I can’t always get them 
                    new things at the same time. I was fortunate enough to find really nice new men and 
                    women sizes that they liked and that were in the sizes that I needed. 
                    Thank you for having this event.”</em></p>

                    SNM asked how receiving new shoes for everyone in her family would make a difference. She responded:</p>
                <p><em>“Thank you, thank you, thank you. My youngest son who is 3 years old was wearing shoes 
                    that were too small and he is walking out of this event with a new pair of shoes and socks 
                    that are the right size. It's really overwhelming in here with how much you have to offer. 
                    Waking up every day praying for help and not knowing my help was in this building is truly a blessing. 
                    Thank you all for having this event.”</em></p>
